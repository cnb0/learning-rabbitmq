# Docker RabbitMQ HA Cluster

:warning: This project **IS NOT** swarm compatible, sorry... but PR welcome :warning:

[Read the documentation](#documentation)

A docker stack to create, test and benchmark a rabbitmq cluster in high availability configuration:

| Tool        | Version |
| -------------: |:-----|
| RabbitMQ      | v3.6.5 |
| HAProxy      | v1.6.3 |
| PHP | v7.1 |
| Docker | v1.12+ |
| Docker-compose | v1.8+ |

* HAProxy as a load balancer
* N nodes cluster
* **Durable**, **Mirrored** and **Persistent** Exchanges, Queues and Messages
* HA custom policies
* Parallel producers and consumers
* **Node failures** and **network partition** experiment

If you have questions, comments or suggestions please just create issues.

:warning: Tested (works well) on Linux but bad performance on OSX (docker for MAC)

## The architecture

![Rabbit cluster](./img/rabbitmq.png)

 * **3 RabbitMQ nodes** but we can add a lot more.
 * **3 docker networks** to be able to simulate network partition.
 * **1 HAProxy node** to load balance request and to be "failure proof".
 * **1 default network** for the consumers and producers to connect with nodes through HAProxy.

## The stack

A lot of great tools (thanks to all awesome authors)

* Make
* Docker and docker-compose
* Rabbitmq and Management Plugin (docker)
* [HAProxy](https://github.com/docker/dockercloud-haproxy)
* Shell scripts
* Symfony MicroFramework (producers and consumers in docker containers)
* [swarrot](https://github.com/swarrot/swarrot) / [swarrot-bundle](https://github.com/swarrot/SwarrotBundle)
* [php-amqplib/rabbitmq-bundle](https://github.com/php-amqplib/RabbitMqBundle)
* [odolbeau/rabbit-mq-admin-toolkit](https://github.com/odolbeau/rabbit-mq-admin-toolkit)

## Tests / Benchmark

With this stack you will be able to experiment:

* Load Balancing
* Node failure
* Network partition
* Messages persistency
* Message NO ACK and retries
